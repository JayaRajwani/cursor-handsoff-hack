# HackOS

HackOS is an AI event company — not a dashboard. It autonomously plans, executes, and manages hackathons through a multi-agent system where each agent owns a real operational function.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run demo         # Run Venue + Community agents on mock London AI hackathon
npm run whatsapp:demo # WhatsApp community walkthrough (mock, no creds)
npm run wassist:check # Verify the live Wassist API key (read-only)
npm run paypal:demo  # End-to-end sponsorship payment flow (mock PayPal, no creds)
npm run paypal:serve # Payment API + operator approval view (mock by default)
npm test             # Run test suite
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
```

## HackOS API

`POST /api/run-hackos`

```json
{
  "goal": "Run an AI hackathon for student builders"
}
```

The endpoint coordinates the Main Organizer Agent, Community Agent WhatsApp plan, Sponsorship Agent, PayPal checkout generation, and Supabase persistence. OpenAI failures fall back to structured mock organizer output. Supabase failures do not fail the request; the response includes `persistence.saved: false`.

Required for live AI and persistence:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

## Agents

### Venue Agent
Finds, compares, and recommends venues with explainable scoring across 11 dimensions, risk analysis, outreach email drafts, and human approval checkpoints before contacting venues.

### Community Agent
Creates Discord server structure (30+ channels), 12 roles with permission logic, welcome flows, rules, 12 announcement templates, bot automation design, moderation workflow, and community health tracking.

Runs a **WhatsApp** community alongside Discord: 12 groups (announcement, discussion, support, per-track, and role-gated private) mirrored to their Discord channels, plus WhatsApp Business broadcast templates derived from the announcement lifecycle. WhatsApp broadcasts reach personal phones, so they sit behind a dedicated high-risk approval checkpoint and an opt-in policy (UTILITY vs MARKETING templates). Toggle with `whatsappEnabled` in the event brief; credentials live in `.env.local` (`WHATSAPP_*`, mock mode by default).

### Sponsorship Agent
Runs the sponsorship money pipeline (interested → meeting booked → verbally committed → payment link sent → paid) and collects payments through **PayPal**. Generates payment intents and PayPal Checkout orders, but never sends a sponsor a payment link without a human approval checkpoint. After payment it marks the commitment paid and produces a receipt message.

## Payments (PayPal)

A production-shaped PayPal Checkout Orders integration with a clean mock mode.

- **`PaymentService`** is the single interface agents use: `createSponsorshipPayment`, `createOrder`, `captureOrder`, `getOrder`, `createPaymentLink`, `handleWebhook`, `verifyWebhookSignature`, `markPayment{Paid,Failed,Pending,Cancelled}`, `approveSendLink`, and `getSponsorshipPaymentsSummary`.
- **Three modes** via `PAYPAL_MODE`: `mock` (default when credentials are absent, no network), `sandbox`, and `live`. Set credentials in `.env.local` — run `npm run setup:paypal` to generate it. See [docs/paypal-sandbox.md](docs/paypal-sandbox.md).
- **Security**: server-side order creation only, webhook signature verification, idempotent/duplicate-event protection, amount + currency guards before capture, no client-side secrets, typed error responses.
- **Data models**: `PaymentIntent`, `SponsorshipCommitment`, `PaymentEvent`.
- **API routes** (`src/api`): `POST /api/payments/paypal/create-order`, `POST /api/payments/paypal/capture-order`, `GET /api/payments/:paymentIntentId`, `POST /api/webhooks/paypal`, `POST /api/payments/:paymentIntentId/approve-send-link`, plus an operator approval view at `GET /payments/approve/:paymentIntentId`.
- Architecture supports participant ticket and vendor payments via the same `PayerType`/`PaymentPurpose` models.

```typescript
const result = await orchestrator.paymentService.createSponsorshipPayment({
  eventId, sponsorId, sponsorName, contactEmail, packageName, amount, currency,
});
// → { paymentIntentId, checkoutUrl, status, messageForSponsor }

orchestrator.askPendingSponsorshipPayments(eventId);
// → { pendingPayments, totalCommitted, totalPaid, totalPending }
```

## Orchestration

```typescript
import { createOrchestrator, mockEventBrief } from "hackos";

const orchestrator = createOrchestrator({ mockMode: true });

await orchestrator.venueAgent.plan(mockEventBrief);
const venueResult = await orchestrator.venueAgent.execute();

await orchestrator.communityAgent.plan(mockEventBrief);
const communityResult = await orchestrator.communityAgent.execute();
```

## Future Integrations

Mock mode is enabled by default. Production integrations planned for:
- Discord API
- WhatsApp Business Cloud API (Meta Graph API / Twilio / 360dialog)
- Google Maps API
- Venue marketplace APIs
- Email API (SendGrid/Resend)
- CRM
- Airtable / Database
- Stripe / Invoicing
- Calendar API
